Super Mario Advance 4 - Super Mario Bros 3 (E-World Hack) (Gameboy Advance)

To get this hack working you will need to hack this rom Super Mario Advance 4 - Super Mario Bros. 3 (U) (V1.1).zip. 

I have uploaded the .sav file and .ips for this hack.

You need to use my .sav file with mGBA to get this game to load. You might get a corruption error but it resolves itself.

For those that don't know where these levels are, you must open Super Mario Bros 3. When it ask you to select a file choose the 4th option (Level Card). This is where the e-World can be found and where achievements take place.

I have tested this and found the achievements work.
